1️⃣ Running a PlatformIO project in VS Code

PlatformIO is used for microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP32, etc.

Steps:
	1.	Install VS Code (if not already installed).
	2.	Install PlatformIO IDE extension:
	•	Open VS Code → Extensions → Search for PlatformIO IDE → Install.
	•	After installation, restart VS Code.
	3.	Open your PlatformIO project:
	•	Either File → Open Folder and select your PlatformIO project folder (it should contain platformio.ini).
	4.	Build and Upload code:
	•	Open PlatformIO Toolbar (usually at the bottom or side panel).
	•	Click Build → This compiles your code.
	•	Connect your microcontroller via USB.
	•	Click Upload → This flashes the code to your board.
	5.	Monitor Serial Output (Optional):
	•	Click Serial Monitor in PlatformIO toolbar.
	•	Select the correct COM port and baud rate to see your device output.

2️⃣ Running a Streamlit app in VS Code

Streamlit is for creating interactive Python apps.

Steps:
	1.	Install Python (if not installed):
	•	Make sure python --version works in terminal.
	2.	Install Streamlit: pip install streamlit
  3.	Open your Streamlit project:
	•	Open the folder containing your .py Streamlit file in VS Code.
	4.	Run the Streamlit app:
	•	Open VS Code Terminal (Ctrl+` ).
	•	Navigate to your file directory.
	•	Run:streamlit run your_file.py
 •	This will open a browser with your Streamlit app (usually at http://localhost:8501).
  5.	Make edits:
	•	Streamlit auto-refreshes your app when you save changes in the .py file.

Optional Tips
	•	Python virtual environment: Always a good idea for Streamlit projects.
 (python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install streamlit)
  
  PlatformIO CLI: You can also use the terminal for building and uploading:
  (pio run          # Build
pio run --target upload  # Upload
pio device monitor       # Serial Monitor)


✅ Once set up, you can switch between your PlatformIO project and Streamlit project in VS Code, but remember:
	•	PlatformIO requires microcontroller hardware connected for upload/serial.
	•	Streamlit requires Python environment and browser to view apps.
